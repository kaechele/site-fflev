"It's rebooting now and will try to establish connections to other Freifunk nodes in the neighborhood. You "
"can place your node now to give it the opportunity to reach as many other nodes as possible via radio. The "
"data you entered, like the node's name, it's position and your contact information, will be transmitted "
"automatically in the mesh network after reboot. We'll only use your contact information to contact you in "
"case of problems. The other data is used to show your Freifunk node on the map, so that others are able to "
"find your hotspot.</p><p><h4>Make the network even stronger!</h4></p> <p>You may now connect your new "
"Freifunk node to your private router to share a portion of your bandwidth. If your node has multiple ports "

"p><p><h4>Sharing is safe!</h4></p><p>Your internet connection is just used to establish a so called VPN "
"(virtual private network) tunnel to our servers. This connection is used to create a shared network for the "
"Freifunk nodes in your community, even when they are out of reach for meshing. The internet connection for "
"this network is provided by the gateway servers of “Verbund freier Netzwerke NRW e.V.“ (VfN NRW). Only the "
"IP addresses of these gateway servers are visible on the internet.</p><p><h4>Change your configuration</h4></"
"p><p>If you'd like to change the configuration of your node, you can boot it in configuration mode. Wait "
"until your node is fully booted and then press and hold the reset button until all lights light up for a "
"brief moment. You are able to change already entered data via the configuration wizard or start expert mode, "
"if you want to configure additional options. For security reasons the configuration wizard is only "
"accessible via a wired LAN connection to the node. Please note that according to the pico peering agreements "
"we require at least an email address to contact you in case of issues.</p><p><h5>Additional information:</"

"perform updates automatically. For security reasons these updates will have to be approved and digitally "
"signed by at least two people of your community. Your node will check the signatures and only updates with "
"two valid signatures will be installed. You can disable the automatic update feature in the expert mode. "
"Please be aware that in this case, we can't ensure the correct operation of your node and aren't able to "
"resolve security issues automatically for you.</li><li>We record statistical information about the usage of "
